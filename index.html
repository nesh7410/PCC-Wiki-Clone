            <h2>Computer Programming</h2>
            <p class="content1">Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called
                programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing
                algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming
                languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible
                to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient
                programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the
                application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms,
                and formal logic.

                Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing,
                debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of
                derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming,
                often the term software development is used for this larger overall process – with the terms
                programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes
                software development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or
                follows an engineering design process.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="content">Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music
                    sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute
                    player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[3][4] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a
                    programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms
                    and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[5][6] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different
                    weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
    
                    Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician
                    Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on
                    Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency
                    analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.[7]
    
                    The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
                    algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
                    Analytical Engine.[8] However, Charles Babbage had already written his first program for the Analytical
                    Engine in 1837.[9]
    
    
                    Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged
                    in program decks.
                    In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[10] Later
                    a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for
                    different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were
                    programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the
                    concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and
                    manipulated in the same way in computer memory.[11]</p>

            <div class="heading4">Machine Language</div>
            
            <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular
                machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer
                specify instruction in a text format (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code
                and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than
                a different notation for a machine language, two machines with different instruction sets also have
                different assembly languages.</p>
               
            <div class="heading4">Compiler Language</div>
            
            <p>High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less
                bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in
                1952[12] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[13][14] FORTRAN, the first widely used
                high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[15] and many other languages
                were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer
                research.

                These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer,
                and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target varying machine instruction sets via
                compilation declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming
                easier[15] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation.

            </figure>
            <div class="heading4">Source code entry</div>
            <p>Programs were mostly entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s, data storage devices
                and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into
                the computers. Text editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much
                more easily than with punched cards.</p>

            <h3 class="heading3">Modern Programming</h3>
            <div class="heading4">Quality requirements</div>
            <p>Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties.
                The following properties are among the most important:[16] [17]

                Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of
                algorithms and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g.,
                buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
                Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations
                such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory,
                operating system services, and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.
                Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its
                intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success
                even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical, and sometimes
                hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's
                user interface.
                Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a
                program can be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities
                provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected
                behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform-specific compilers (and
                sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.
                Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in
                order to make improvements or to customize, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new
                environments. Good practices[18] during initial development make the difference in this regard. This
                quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a
                program over the long term.
                Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space,
                slow devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the
                better. This also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up temporary files and
                eliminating memory leaks. This is often discussed under the shadow of a chosen programming language.
                Although the language certainly affects performance, even slower languages, such as Python, can execute
                programs instantly from a human perspective. Speed, resource usage, and performance are important for
                programs that bottleneck the system, but efficient use of programmer time is also important and is
                related to cost: more hardware may be cheaper.</p>

            <div class="heading4">Readibility Of Source Code</div>
            <p>In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the
                purpose, control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including
                portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.

                Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to
                understand, reusing and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable
                code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study found that a few simple
                readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.[19]

                Following a consistent programming style often helps readability. However, readability is more than just
                programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to
                efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.[20] Some of these factors include:

                Different indent styles (whitespace)
                Comments
                Decomposition
                Naming conventions for objects (such as variables, classes, functions, procedures, etc.)
                The presentation aspects of this (such as indents, line breaks, color highlighting, and so on) are often
                handled by the source code editor, but the content aspects reflect the programmer's talent and skills.

                Various visual programming languages have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability
                concerns by adopting non-traditional approaches to code structure and display. Integrated development
                environments (IDEs) aim to integrate all such help. Techniques like Code refactoring can enhance
                readability.</p>

            <div class="heading4">Algorithmic Complexity</div>
            <p>The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with
                discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problems. For this
                purpose, algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource
                use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers
                are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use
                this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.</p>

            <div class="heading4">Methodologies</div>
            <p>The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by
                testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a
                lot of different approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for requirements analysis is
                Use Case analysis. Many programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages of
                formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather
                than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process.

                Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Model-Driven
                Architecture (MDA). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.

                A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling).

                Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional
                languages, and logic languages.</p>

            <div class="heading4">Debugging</div>
            <p>It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular modern programming languages. Methods of
                measuring programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that
                mention the language,[21] the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates
                the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the
                language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).

                Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly
                used to write many different kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in corporate data
                centers[22] often on large mainframe computers, Fortran in engineering applications, scripting languages
                in Web development, and C in embedded software. Many applications use a mix of several languages in
                their construction and use. New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language
                with new functionality added, (for example C++ adds object-orientation to C, and Java adds memory
                management and bytecode to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency and the ability for low-level
                manipulation).</p>
